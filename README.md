# AdClick_Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on their online activity and demographic information. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, with a focus on improving the accuracy of ad-click predictions to support more effective marketing strategies.

## Key Features:

### Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaned and transformed raw data to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for model training. This included handling missing values, normalizing numerical data, and encoding categorical variables.

### Feature Engineering: 
Created new features from existing data to enhance the predictive power of the model, including interaction terms and time-based features to capture user behavior patterns.

### Model Development: 
Implemented a logistic regression model as the primary algorithm for binary classification of ad-clicks. Explored alternative models such as decision trees and random forests for comparison.

### Model Evaluation: 
Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance. Fine-tuned hyperparameters and applied cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure model robustness.

### Insights and Optimization: 
Provided actionable insights based on model outputs, suggesting key factors influencing ad-click behavior. Optimized model performance by iterating on feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

## Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees
Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

## Outcome: 
Successfully developed a predictive model with high accuracy in identifying users likely to click on ads, aiding in better targeting and resource allocation for digital marketing campaigns.
